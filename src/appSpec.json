The design balances the airy spaciousness of Serene Minimalism with the organized density of a Bento Grid, resulting in a layout that feels both calming and abundant. The color palette is drawn directly from nature, evoking a sense of warmth, health, and sustainability.\n\n**Execution Blueprint:**\n1. The Full-Bleed Canvas: The design will utilize the full viewport width, creating an immersive experience. Sections will extend to the screen edges, with content framed internally by padding.\n2. The 8px Grid System: All spacing, margins, and padding will adhere to an 8px base unit, ensuring visual harmony and rhythm.\n3. Rounded Cards: All cards will have rounded corners (10-14px) and subtle shadows to create a soft, tactile feel.\n4. Typographic Harmony: Elegant serif headlines will be paired with geometric sans-serif body text to create a balance of sophistication and readability.\n5. The Bento Category Grid: The 'Shop by Category' section will be implemented as a Bento Grid, showcasing a variety of product categories in an organized and visually appealing manner.",

Black is used for primary text to ensure clarity and contrast. UI elements like buttons and forms are understated with thin borders and minimal styling, reinforcing the clean and sophisticated feel. Photography is natural and organic but excluded from the core palette, serving to enhance the brand's authentic and quality-driven personality. Overall, the design communicates a refined, approachable, and organic brand identity suitable for premium, artisanal, or natural product brands.",

The 'primary' color is ideal for headings, key text elements, and interactive text such as links and buttons, paired with 'primaryForeground' for contrast on dark backgrounds like the footer. The 'secondary' color serves well for section backgrounds or subtle highlights, with 'secondaryForeground' used for text on these backgrounds to maintain readability. The 'footerBackground' anchors the page footer with a deep, rich tone, contrasting with 'primaryForeground' text for accessibility. The 'linkColor' and 'buttonBorder' colors are used for interactive elements, ensuring they stand out while maintaining the natural, elegant aesthetic. This palette supports a calm, sophisticated atmosphere with strong accessibility and visual harmony.",
          "paletteAccessibilityNotes": "The 'primaryForeground' on 'primary' and 'footerBackground' colors meet WCAG AA contrast standards for large and normal text, ensuring readability. The 'secondaryForeground' on 'secondary' also meets contrast requirements for body text. Links and buttons using 'linkColor' and 'buttonBorder' on 'background' or 'secondary' backgrounds maintain sufficient contrast for accessibility compliance."

The color palette is drawn directly from nature, evoking a sense of warmth, health, and sustainability.\n\n**Execution Blueprint:**\n1. The Full-Bleed Canvas: The design will utilize the full viewport width, creating an immersive experience. Sections will extend to the screen edges, with content framed internally by padding.\n2. The 8px Grid System: All spacing, margins, and padding will adhere to an 8px base unit, ensuring visual harmony and rhythm.\n3. Rounded Cards: All cards will have rounded corners (10-14px) and subtle shadows to create a soft, tactile feel.\n4. Typographic Harmony: Elegant serif headlines will be paired with geometric sans-serif body text to create a balance of sophistication and readability.\n5. The Bento Category Grid: The 'Shop by Category' section will be implemented as a Bento Grid, showcasing a variety of product categories in an organized and visually appealing manner.",
